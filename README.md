**Coming soon.**

Follow [NotGaylien](https://github.com/NotGaylien) for progress on the 3D assets powering this technology. We will have virtual abductions, probing, and more! Will you cure Letty of her [Toxoplasmosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis)? It may require a deep journey into her most sacred cavities! ðŸ‘€

This will be bigger than [JoyrideUniverse!](https://joyrideuniverse.com/)

[fishtank.blend](fishtank.blend) is a game-ready adaption of [NotGaylien's original V2 FishTank model](https://github.com/NotGaylien). All you need to do is trianglulate the mesh and you're good to go.
